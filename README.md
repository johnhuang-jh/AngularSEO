# What's AngularSEO

AngularSEO Filter is a SEO solution for AJAX frond-end sites with a JavaEE backend. The AJAX frond-end can be AngularJS, ReactJS and other AJAX frameworks.

# How it works?

## Integrate SEO filter on JEE server
Add a filter into web.xml, and set its URL mapping to '/*'.

## Pre-render static page snapshot
When server started, SEO filter will crawl self site and generate static page snapshot for each one with all the dynamic content fully rendered. It will update the snapshots regularly according your configure.

## Let crawlers see static content
SEO filter identify the crawl request by checking the User-Agent keyword. If it contains keywords such like Googlebot, Bingbot, etc, filter will response with the pre-rendered static page from the snapshot.

## All hashbang URL are well transformed
All hashbang URLs will be transformed to normal format which can be crawled more easily. 

For example: 

http://www.abc.com/#!/about -> http://www.abc.com/_23_21/about

http://www.abc.com/#/about -> http://www.abc.com/_23/about

So, you needn't care any speical rule of hashbang URL crawling specification.
When user click the transformed links from search engine, SEO filter will be convered it to original URL again.

# Original page source VS Rendered static page source

Original AngularJS page source code:
```
<a href="#about"><div ng-bind="message"></div></a>
```
->
Rendered static page source code:
```
<a href="http://host/_23/about"><div ng-bind="message">the true message after binding</div></a>
```
# Features

* Easy setup: configure a filter only
* Zero code change: needn't change any front-end and backend codes
* Fast page loads: snapshot is prerendered & stored on the same server
* Fully automated: it keeps working in the background after setup
* It is FREE!
* It is open source!

# Requirements

The static site is generated by [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/), so it need be installed on the server. 

# More

I built a simple AngularJS site http://www.angularseo.net to validate it. After one day, it already be crawled correctly by Google and Bing. You can search Angularseo.net and check the cache result. I also tested with Google and Baidu spider tool, the crawl result is correct too.
